### Projects

##### Logistic Regression Model Example: Credit Risk Classification 
* https://github.com/jerryevalentine/Data-Science-Flask-Application
* The purpose of the project is to compare the difference in project length for projects that use AI to code versus those projects that perform manual coding.
* This is a work in progress as there are 35 seperate modules that need to be created and integrated into the main application.
* The full software development process is applied to each of the seperate modules.
* Data will be collected as each development item is completed to provide an estimate of the time saved by using AI for coding.
* As more Flask modules are created the better the estimate of the time saved.


##### Logistic Regression Model Example: Credit Risk Classification 
* https://github.com/jerryevalentine/credit-risk-classification
* Developed a logistic regression model using scikit-learn to predict
* Implemented data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
* Achieved a high degree of accuracy on the test dataset.
* Created a detailed README with instructions for running the code and interpreting results.
